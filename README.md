🌦️ Challenge - Weather App
Welcome to the Weather App Challenge!
This repository contains the implementation of a simple weather application that retrieves and displays weather information using the OpenWeather API.

We use predefined latitude and longitude coordinates from various cities to fetch and display detailed weather data, such as:
🌡️ Temperature
💧 Humidity
🌬️ Pressure
